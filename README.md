## üìò Overview  

This repository provides a **comparative implementation and analysis** of five Identity-Based Identification (IBI) schemes, all developed in **Python** using **Elliptic Curve Cryptography (ECC)**.  

The goal is to evaluate the **runtime performance and memory efficiency** of various IBI protocols, with special attention to **resource-constrained devices** such as **IoT nodes and smart cards**.

## üß† Implemented Schemes  

| Scheme | Description |
|--------|--------------|
| **1. Twin-Schnorr IBI Scheme** | Improves security using two parallel Schnorr signatures. |
| **2. Modified-Schnorr IBI Scheme** | Pairing-free variant balancing efficiency and security. |
| **3. Sakai‚ÄìKasahara IBI Scheme** | ECC pairing-based, providing robust identification guarantees. |
| **4. Fiat‚ÄìShamir IBI Scheme** | Zero-knowledge proof system with strong simplicity. |
| **5. Efficient Zero-Knowledge IBI Scheme** | Optimized for smart cards with minimal computation and memory footprint. |

## ‚öôÔ∏è Key Features  

- **Full Python Implementation:** Built using the `cryptography` and `tinyec` libraries.  
- **Profiling Metrics:** Uses Python‚Äôs `time` and `tracemalloc` modules to record **runtime** and **memory usage**.  
- **Server‚ÄìClient Simulation:** Flask-based environment mimicking real-world authentication flow.  
- **ECC-Focused:** Designed to operate over elliptic curves for lightweight performance.  
- **Research-Oriented:** Enables comparative analysis across five cryptographic IBI frameworks.

## üìä Results and Analysis

The project benchmarks **runtime (seconds)** and **memory (KB)** for the following operations:

* Key Generation
* Proving
* Verification

Each scheme was profiled under identical conditions to ensure fair comparison.

Future iterations may include automated chart generation for visual performance comparison.

## üî¨ Research Significance

This implementation provides a practical comparison of several IBI approaches, offering insight into:

* Performance trade-offs between pairing-based and pairing-free methods.
* Resource efficiency in elliptic-curve-based identity verification.
* Applicability of IBI systems in lightweight IoT or embedded devices.
